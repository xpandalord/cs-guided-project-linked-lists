"""
Given only a reference to a specific node in a linked list, delete that node from a singly-linked list.
​
Example:
​
The code below should first construct a linked list (x -> y -> z) and then delete `y` from the linked list by calling the function `delete_node`. It is your job to write the `delete_node` function.
​
```python
class LinkedListNode():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None
​
x = LinkedListNode('X')
y = LinkedListNode('Y')
z = LinkedListNode('Z')
​
x.next = y
y.next = z
​
delete_node(y)
```
​
*Note: We can do this in O(1) time and space! But be aware that our solution will have some side effects...*

        self.value = value
        self.next  = None

    # check if `node_to_delete` is the last node in the ll 
    if node_to_delete.next is None:
        # traverse to the node right before the tail so that we can 
        # change its next reference 
        # this isn't possible because we don't have access to the head 
        raise Exception("This function can't delete the tail")
    else:
        # change our `node_to_delete`'s value to be its next's value 
        node_to_delete.value = node_to_delete.next.value 
        # change our `node_to_delete`'s next to refer to its next's next 
        node_to_delete.next = node_to_delete.next.next

    # init a new variable to refer to the node we have 
    # access to 
    current = head
